# Composite-AV-Adapter

Quick Note: There are two versions of this board. The easier one to build (v1.1 or 02, 20 SEP 2019) is the DIY through-hole version. The SMD (v2.0 or 04, 10 DEC 2019) version is smaller, but requires surface-mount components. Functionally, they are identical.

For BOTH versions, this is the correct AV cable to use: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKMBB9L
